Toxiclibs.js is a javascript port of Karsten Schmidt's Toxiclibs for Java and Processing. Toxiclibs.js works great with the Processing.js visualization library for <canvas> but is not dependent on it. It can be used with other libraries such as Raphael.js, Three.js or by itself.



* Examples of the original library can be found at http://toxiclibs.org

Toxiclibs.js was initiated on 1/5/2011 by Kyle Phillips [http://haptic-data.com](http://haptic-data.com)
