Toxiclibs.js is a javascript port of Karsten Schmidt's Toxiclibs for Java and Processing. Toxiclibs.js works great with the Processing.js visualization library for <canvas> but is not dependent on it. It can be used with other libraries such as Raphael.js, or by itself.


* Examples of the original library can be found at http://toxiclibs.org
